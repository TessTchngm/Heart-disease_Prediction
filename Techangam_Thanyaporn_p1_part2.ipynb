    "#  1) Problem Introduction & Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "   As my family has a heart disease background for a really long time, my grandfather had it before he passed, my cousins have it. Therefore, I know how severe this disease can be and how hard to cope with it. That is why I want to come up with a way to predict whether which/ how many symptoms or factors that tend to indicate a sign of heart disease. If that can be possible, atleast more or less, people can prevent the severity by contacting doctor before their conditions will get worse.    \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Digging into the internet, I found out that there are around 550 million individuals worldwide, or 1 in 14 of us known to be suffering from cardiovascular diseases **:(**. Moreover, heart disease is **THE NUMBER ONE** cause of death for both men and women in the United States. It accounts for 40% of all U.S. deaths, more than all forms of cancer combined! These reports issue the fact that this is a serious disease which we should be precautious about. \n",
    "   \n",
    "  Heart disease also, costs the United States Healthcare 316.4 billion annually and causing 147 billion in lost productivity on the job. All facts mentioned inevitably require a way to help screening the tendency to have a heart disease. The sooner the better. Thus, one of the ways to help is to use Machine learning techniques by buiding a model which can simulate the factors and providing risk tendency of having a heart disease result to patient. Providing a chance for them to treat it sooner before it is too late. \n",
    "  \n",
    "**Actually there are tons of researches/ articles that can be very useful in these project!!!**     \n",
