# Heart-disease_prediction
This project aims to develop a classification model for predicting the presence or absence of heart disease based on a dataset of nearly 300 medical patients. By analyzing five key patient characteristics, our goal is to create an accurate and reliable predictive model that can aid in diagnosing heart disease.
